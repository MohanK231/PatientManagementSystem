"# PatientManagementSystem"

**Overview of MohanK231/PatientManagementSystem**

The PatientManagementSystem is designed to manage various aspects of patient care and services. The system is modular, consisting of several services that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for patient management. Below is an overview of its goals, main modules, and how they fit together.



**Goals**

The primary goals of the PatientManagementSystem include:



**Patient Management:** To provide functionalities for managing patient records, including creation, updates, and retrieval of patient information.

Billing Services: To handle billing and payment processes associated with patient care.

Security: To ensure secure access and management of sensitive patient data through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Analytics: To gather and analyze data related to patient care and service usage for better decision-making.

**Main Modules**

The system is divided into several key modules, each responsible for specific functionalities:



**Patient Service**



Path: patient-service/src/main/java/com/pm/patientservice

Description: Manages patient records, including creating, updating, and retrieving patient information. It includes controllers, services, and data transfer objects (DTOs) for handling patient data.



**Billing Service**



Path: billing-service/src/main/java/com/pm/billingservice

Description: Responsible for managing billing processes, including generating invoices and processing payments. It integrates with the patient service to link billing information with patient records.



**Analytics Service**



Path: analytics-service/src/main/java/com/pm/analyticsservice

Description: Collects and analyzes data from the patient and billing services to provide insights into patient care and service efficiency.



**API Gateway**



Path: api-gateway/src/main/java/com/pm/apigateway

Description: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate service. It also handles cross-cutting concerns such as authentication and logging.



**Security Service**



Path: security-service/src/main/java/com/example/securityservice

Description: Manages user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive patient data.



**Infrastructure**



Path: infrastructure/src/main/java/org/pm/stack

Description: Provides the necessary infrastructure for deploying and managing the services, including configuration and deployment scripts.



**Integration Tests**



Path: integration-tests/src/main/java/org/pm

Description: Contains tests to ensure that the various services work together as expected, validating the overall functionality of the system.

How They Fit Together

The modules are designed to work together in a microservices architecture:



The API Gateway serves as the entry point for client applications, directing requests to the appropriate service (Patient, Billing, Analytics, or Security).

The Patient Service and Billing Service interact closely, as billing information is tied to patient records.

The Analytics Service collects data from both the Patient and Billing Services to generate reports and insights.

The Security Service ensures that all interactions with the system are secure, protecting sensitive patient information.

The Infrastructure module supports the deployment and management of these services, ensuring they can be scaled and maintained effectively.

This modular approach allows for flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance, making the PatientManagementSystem a robust solution for managing patient care.
